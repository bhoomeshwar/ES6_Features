# ES6_Features
- ES6 refers to version 6 of the ECMA Script programming language. ECMA Script is the standardized name for JavaScript.
- ECMAScript, or ES6, was published in June 2015. It was subsequently renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Web browser support for the full language is not yet complete, though major portions are supported. Major web browsers support some features of ES6. However, it is possible to use software known as a transpiler to convert ES6 code into ES5, which is better supported on most browsers.

- ES6 is finalized but not fully supported by all browsers (e.g., ES6 Firefox support). To use ES6 today, get a compiler like Babel. You can run it as a standalone tool or use it with your build system.
